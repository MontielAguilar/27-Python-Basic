    - `variables.py`: Shows how to create numeric and string variables, as well as perform basic operations with them.

3. **Working with Numbers**
    - `working_with_numbers.py`: Example of basic numerical operations and rounding of numbers.

4. **Working with Strings**
    - `working_with_strings.py`: Demonstrates various string operations, such as finding substrings, converting to lowercase, etc.

5. **Working with Booleans**
    - `working_with_booleans.py`: Example of basic boolean operations.

6. **Working with Lists**
    - `working_with_lists.py`: Example of list manipulation, including deletion, concatenation, and sorting.

7. **Working with Tuples**
    - `working_with_tuples.py`: Example of operations with tuples, including accessing elements and generating errors when trying to modify them.

8. **Working with Dictionaries**
    - `working_with_dictionaries.py`: Shows how to work with dictionaries in Python, including insertion, deletion, and access to elements.

9. **Working with Sets**
    - `working_with_sets.py`: Example of basic set operations, such as difference, intersection, and membership verification.

10. **Working with Conditions (if, elif, else)**
    - `working_with_conditions.py`: Example of conditional structures to handle different cases according to the given conditions.

11. **Working with Loops (for and while)**
    - `working_with_loops.py`: Example of `for` and `while` loops to iterate over lists and perform repetitive operations.

## Execution
To run any of the examples, simply execute the corresponding Python file from the command line or your preferred development environment.
